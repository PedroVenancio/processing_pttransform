Portugal datum transformation for Processing
--------------------------------------
Portugal Datum Transfromation tools for Processing.

Processing (former SEXTANTE) is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to
call native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis
tasks more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin allows to trasform raster and vectors from obsolete mainland Portugal 
CRSs (Datum 73, Datum Lisboa and ED50) to the new official CRS 
(ETRS89-PTTM06) using NTv2 datum transformation grids.

Supported NTv2 grids are the ones provided by Prof. José Alberto Gonçalves and the ones
provided by the Direção-Geral do Território (DGT), see:

The grids files are shipped with the plugin, so no further actions are required by the user.

The plugin was developed by Alexander Bruy, Pedro Venâncio and Faunalia (http://www.faunalia.eu/) with 
the Supporte of the Portugal QGIS User Group,
